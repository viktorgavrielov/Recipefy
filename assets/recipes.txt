1: For crust: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Combine cookie crumbs and 5 tablespoons butter in medium bowl. Stir until crumbs are evenly coated and beginning to stick together. Press crumb mixture in thin even layer onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Bake crust until set and beginning to crisp, pressing with back of fork if crust puffs, about 15 minutes. Cool crust completely on rack.
2: For filling and topping :Sprinkle almond paste over crust. Gently press to even layer. Place chocolate in medium bowl. Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan. Pour cream over chocolate. Let stand 1 minute, then whisk until melted and smooth. Pour ganache evenly over almond layer. Chill tart until chocolate is cold and set, at least 4 hours.
3: Arrange raspberries, pointed side up, over top of tart. Stir jam and kirsch in small pan over low heat until blended and heated through. Brush glaze over berries. Sprinkle almonds around edge of tart. Chill uncovered.
4: Using small sharp knife, loosen crust from pan sides. Push up pan bottom, releasing tart. Cut into wedges; serve cold.
